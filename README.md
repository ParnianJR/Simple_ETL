# Simple_ETL
This is my final project for Database course.  
This project contains 3 parts:  
**schema.sql**: Designing and buliding a relational database for a library in *5NF*.  
**source_code.py**: Builds a simple pipeline between 2 Postgres databases that transfers data record by record from 
database1 to database2 using topological graph.   
**Data_Warehouse.sql** : Contains *history* tables to record deleted or modified records of our main database.
